# Fashion-MNIST-Autoencoder
This project implements an Autoencoder using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Autoencoder is trained to compress (encode) and then reconstruct (decode) images from the dataset. Additionally, it is tested on its ability to remove noise from images, showcasing its potential as a denoising autoencoder.
